bugs:

- buggy encoding on line 173 -- we need long int storage???
	- skip actual decimals; Base64.encode supports encoding from strings...
	- Base64.encode is encoding ASCII, not decimals. Google "decimal to base64 javascript" or binary to base64
- handle saving??? or just skip and change button to "share"
	- update save, so we can have galleries. Also good to ref dataURL versions...
	- store author names?

other:

- store hi-res version of icon for larger display??
	- or just make an efficient javascript view-only renderer
- add 4-color mode as option (longer URLs)
- grid integer spacing
- social media barf
